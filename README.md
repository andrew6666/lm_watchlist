Tips
====
* Title does not need to be full e.g. 'homeland s01' will hit 'Homeland s01e01' and 'My Homeland S01E08'
* Lower/Uppercase does not matter
* You should set torrent results count to maximum in profile settings (currently its 100)
* If you want to watch only for newest season, just add season number at the end e.g. 'homeland s04'
* Works also on '5 zona'
